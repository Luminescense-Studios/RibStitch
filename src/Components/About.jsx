                    Knitting is a skill that was passed on from family elders to children.
                    Due to the amount of resources available online one can learn to knit
                    but one has to spend a lot of time to go through the right tutorial
                    at the right time and not get bogged down in
                    Tutorial Hell without creating something useful.
                    <br /> <br />
                    We aim to provide a development plan and a roadmap for a new comer
                    so that they can have a clear path and understanding of what skills are needed to
                    create beautiful designs and knit their creative ideas on the needles
